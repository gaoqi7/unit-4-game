# Star War RPG

This is a small project used for practicing the jQuery. In this project, the Html elements will be added,deleted,replaced even moved around. The most challenge part for me is **selecting the _right_ content in a _right_ way**. I found the `class` is very useful. I use the `class` to create the difference and screen the content out.

Because of this project, I have a new understanding about the `append()`. It all coming below.
When we use

> "adding" method such as append(), appendTo() or prepend() to add the selected elements to another parent element. jQuery automatically realises that the element(s) to add already exist in the page, and it moves the element(s) to the new parent.

which means this is not copy and we don't need `empty()`.

There is one great article about [this topic](https://www.elated.com/articles/jquery-removing-replacing-moving-elements/).

Also,I want to say thank you to my classmate **Jeff** for pointing out one bug for me, which give me a chance to rethink my codes and optimize them.
